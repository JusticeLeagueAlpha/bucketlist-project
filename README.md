# Bubble Bucket

With this project we wanted to make a fun, visual way to keep track of goals you are trying to complete. People often say they don't want to burst your bubble when they try to give you a reality check, so we thought we would store each goal in its own bubble, that way you can burst them yourself when you achieve them.

## Issues

- We initially were unsure of whether or not we could edit a modal enough to make it look like it wasn't a bootstrap modal at all
- Incorporating a third party API was something we wanted to do but deciding which one took a lot of research.
